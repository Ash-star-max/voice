This project demonstrates a voice-enabled form-filling application built using Python, Flask, and speech recognition technologies. The primary objective is to create a seamless experience for users to input personal details by speaking instead of typing.

Features:
Real-Time Speech Recognition: Captures and processes voice inputs instantly.
Personal Detail Form: Collects essential user information like name, email, and phone number.
Flask Backend: Ensures smooth routing and server-side operations.
Enhanced Accessibility: Simplifies form filling for users with typing challenges.
